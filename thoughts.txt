Even though it takes a long time, the process of producing these prototypes is providing a lot of insight into needed behaviours. I'll plough ahead with these for now and reassess at the end of the project.

I need to build these website prototypes in order to make sure that the libraries I am building for:
 - storage
 - ui
 are forced into being generic enough to serve at least 3 use cases. This makes the libraries more robust, and more aligned with the needs of generic solution assembly.
However:
 - I'm falling more and more behind in schedule and building these mockups is actually quite time consuming. I keep thinking of more and more things which would need to be done for the prototype to be completed.
 - It's not particularly fun. Things which are fun are generally predicters of better results.
